Authorities assessed that Truebot infections are primarily motivated around collection and exfiltration of sensitive victim data for financial gain.

As early as January, one set of actors exploited CVE-2022-47966, a vulnerability in the Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus IT service management application that allows remote code execution, to access the organization’s public-facing web servers. A separate set of actors was also observed exploiting CVE-2022-42475, a vulnerability in Fortinet, Inc.’s FortiOS SSL-VPN that also allows remote code execution, to gain access to the organization’s firewall devices.\n\nAfter gaining access, the actors downloaded malware, performed network discovery, collected administrator credentials, and moved laterally, but according to the advisory, unclear data storage records inhibited insight into whether any proprietary information was accessed, altered, or exfiltrated.

Actors collected device information and conducted further network reconnaissance on victims “worldwide”, including U.S. government institutions, 250 Ukrainian entities, and “a small number” of victims elsewhere in Europe. Adversary activity occurred over an unspecified timeframe in 2021.\n\nActors exploited CVE-2017-6742, a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) vulnerability for which Cisco released a patch in 2017, and used default authentication strings to gain initial access to devices and subsequently gather router information, such as router interface details. In some cases, authorities observed actors deploying Jaguar Tooth, a malicious software bundle consisting of a series of payloads and patches.

According to the advisory, these actors are also known as APT29, the Dukes, CozyBear, and NOBELIUM/Midnight Blizzard.\n\nCVE-2023-42793 is an authentication bypass vulnerability in the JetBrains TeamCity software development program. After exploiting the vulnerability to gain access into victim networks, SVR actors were then observed escalating privileges, moving laterally, and deploying additional backdoors in an apparent effort to maintain long-term persistent access to victim environments. The advisory noted how SVR actors used access gained during the 2020 compromise of SolarWinds, another software company, to conduct supply chain operations affecting SolarWinds customers, but it also noted that such activity has not been observed in this case to date.\n\nJetBrains released a patch for CVE-2023-42793 in September 2023. The advisory indicated that the compromises observed to date appear to be opportunistic, impacting unpatched, internet-accessible TeamCity servers. “A few dozen” compromised entities have been identified so far (companies in disparate sectors in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Australia), but authorities assess that this tally does not represent the full number of compromised victims.

The advisory updated a previous alert (AA21-321A), published in November 2021, and summarized recent activities linked to the actors. Since at least March 2021, the actors were observed targeting victims in a wide range of U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including transportation and healthcare, and victims in unspecified sectors in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe actors typically exploited vulnerabilities to gain initial network access. They were observed exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers (ProxyShell) and Fortinet devices in 2021, and VMware Horizon (Log4j) in 2022. After gaining access, the actors typically evaluated the perceived value of data held within a victim network and either encrypted it for ransom and/or exfiltrated it. The actors are believed to have sold some exfiltrated data or used it as leverage to further pressure victims into paying a ransom.\n\nIn addition to behavioral observations and indicators of compromise, the advisories provided detection and mitigation guidance, which can be found in the source reports [here](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa22-257a) and [here](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa21-321a).\n\n**Related Vulnerabilities**: CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105<sup>[[U.S. CISA IRGC Actors September 14 2022](/references/728b20b0-f702-4dbe-afea-50270648a3a2)]</sup>, CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2020-12812, CVE-2019-5591<sup>[[U.S. CISA Iranian Government Actors November 19 2021](/references/d7014279-bc6a-43d4-953a-a6bc1d97a13b)]</sup>",

In some cases, the actors ultimately exfiltrated victim data and encrypted files, demanding payment in order to decrypt affected systems (the Advisory did not indicate how precisely actors encrypted data).

      "description": "The [SolarWinds Compromise](https://app.tidalcyber.com/campaigns/8bde8146-0656-5800-82e6-e24e008e4f4a) was a sophisticated supply chain cyber operation conducted by [APT29](https://app.tidalcyber.com/groups/4c3e48b9-4426-4271-a7af-c3dfad79f447) that was discovered in mid-December 2020. [APT29](https://app.tidalcyber.com/groups/4c3e48b9-4426-4271-a7af-c3dfad79f447) used customized malware to inject malicious code into the SolarWinds Orion software build process that was later distributed through a normal software update; they also used password spraying, token theft, API abuse, spear phishing, and other supply chain attacks to compromise user accounts and leverage their associated access. Victims of this campaign included government, consulting, technology, telecom, and other organizations in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Industry reporting initially referred to the actors involved in this campaign as UNC2452, NOBELIUM, StellarParticle, Dark Halo, and SolarStorm.<sup>[[SolarWinds Advisory Dec 2020](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/4e8b908a-bdc5-441b-bc51-98dfa87f6b7a)]</sup><sup>[[SolarWinds Sunburst Sunspot Update January 2021](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1be1b6e0-1b42-4d07-856b-b6321c17bb88)]</sup><sup>[[FireEye SUNBURST Backdoor December 2020](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/d006ed03-a8af-4887-9356-3481d81d43e4)]</sup><sup>[[Volexity SolarWinds](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/355cecf8-ef3e-4a6e-a652-3bf26fe46d88)]</sup><sup>[[CrowdStrike StellarParticle January 2022](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/149c1446-d6a1-4a63-9420-def9272d6cb9)]</sup><sup>[[Unit 42 SolarStorm December 2020](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/ecbb602a-2427-5eba-8c2b-25d90c95f166)]</sup><sup>[[Microsoft Analyzing Solorigate Dec 2020](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/8ad72d46-ba2c-426f-bb0d-eb47723c8e11)]</sup><sup>[[Microsoft Internal Solorigate Investigation Blog](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/66cade99-0040-464c-98a6-bba57719f0a4)]</sup> \n\nIn April 2021, the US and UK governments attributed the [SolarWinds Compromise](https://app.tidalcyber.com/campaigns/8bde8146-0656-5800-82e6-e24e008e4f4a) to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR); public statements included citations to [APT29](https://app.tidalcyber.com/groups/4c3e48b9-4426-4271-a7af-c3dfad79f447), Cozy Bear, and The Dukes.<sup>[[NSA Joint Advisory SVR SolarWinds April 2021](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/43d9c469-1d54-454b-ba67-74e7f1de9c10)]</sup><sup>[[UK NSCS Russia SolarWinds April 2021](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/f49e6780-8caa-4c3c-8d68-47a2cc4319a1)]</sup><sup>[[Mandiant UNC2452 APT29 April 2022](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/5276508c-6792-56be-b757-e4b495ef6c37)]</sup> The US government assessed that of the approximately 18,000 affected public and private sector customers of Solar Winds’ Orion product, a much smaller number were compromised by follow-on [APT29](https://app.tidalcyber.com/groups/4c3e48b9-4426-4271-a7af-c3dfad79f447) activity on their systems.<sup>[[USG Joint Statement SolarWinds January 2021](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/336a6549-a95d-5763-bbaf-5ef0d3141800)]</sup> ",
